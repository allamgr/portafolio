# portafolio

## Why I created this?

As developers we don't like to spend too much time creating a CV, this was my case and I decide to make a reusable and extensible library in react (thinking to replicate this in VueJs) with the purpose of use it in my own CV. You would say, "But you will spend more time doing this library than your own Resume" and yeah maybe you're 110% right, but I want to save other people time.

portafolio is a react library that can be used to build your Resume/CV very fast with only a JSON file with the required information by the library.

## Install

Using npm:

```sh
npm install --save @allamgr/portafolio
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn add @allamgr/portafolio
```

## How to use

```sh
import { PersonalInfo } from '@allamgr/portafolio'
```

## Templates

For now, there is only one template available, as soon I have more time will be adding new ones, and since this is open-source the dev community can collaborate to create new templates.

## Segmentable

For those ones who already have a template and just want to use any component separated, you can just import that into your project without any problem.

## How to collaborate

Since this will be my first serious repository on GitHub I do not have too much experience with pull requests standards, so you can do pull requests to this repository and I will be approving the ones that I consider are with my vision. Be patient as soon this library becomes more important to the community it will be a great enhancement on how you can collaborate.

## Thanks to

- [Build, test and release a React component library with Storybook](Tutorial2).
